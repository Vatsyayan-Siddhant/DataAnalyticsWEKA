Linear Regression is an approach for modeling the relationship between a scalar dependent variable ‘Y’ and one/more explanatory independent variables denoted as ‘X’.

To understand this in detail let’s develop a code using WEKA’s jar.

Step#1: We need to download weka-3.7.0.jar file.

Step#2: Save the data as house.arff file.

Step#3: Finally, we need to write the code snippet to predict the Selling Price of the home.


Conclusion:
The predicted price for the house with data :
HouseSize = 2983
LotSize = 9365
Bedrooms = 5
Granite = 0
Bathroom =1
SellingPrice = 230000

The output came up as 222921.57 which is very close to 230000.
